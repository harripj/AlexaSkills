## Privacy Policy for Alexa Skills

This privacy policy describes how Patrick Harrison (paddyh087) ("the developer", "us" or "we") protects your ("you", "the user") privacy and your data. Before using any of our Alexa Skills ("our skills"), please read this policy and our Alexa Skills Terms of Use, as well as the Alexa Terms of Use and the Privacy Policies by the Amazon Digital Services LLC (with its affiliates, "Amazon").
Regarding Amazon, "Alexa" means their Alexa Voice Service which includes third party services (like our skills) and other related Software.
If you use one of our skills you fully agree to this privacy policy.

### General
When you use our skills you have to talk to Alexa. This voice input is sent to Amazon and us where we use it to understand how our skill should operate for you. This is necessary for our service to function and to give you an appropriate answer.

### Data
We never collect or share personal data with our skills.
To improve our services we may analyze how often utterances are spoken and other analytics. This is done automatically by Amazon in the Amazon Developer Portal.
For some of our skills it is necessary to save data for you in our databases. This data is connected to your Alexa-UserID but never to your name or any other personal information.

### Changes
We may update our skills, including their functionality, periodically or at any time. This Privacy Policy may change. You can find a link to this policy on the description page of the skill in the Alexa App or in the Alexa Store. Your continued use of our skill after changes of the Privacy Policy or the skill itself will be seen as your acceptance of both.
